1) hugo new site netlifycms

2) 
PS C:\Hugo> cd .\netlifycms\
PS C:\Hugo\netlifycms> hugo server


3) In the layouts/ directory, create a file index.html and put a basic HTML structure in there:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Nice. It's looking good already.</h1>
  </body>
</html>


4) You'll also add some files to the content/ and data/ directories to make sure git tracks them.
touch content/.keep data/.keep



git add . 
git commit -m "Initial Commit" 
git remote add origin https://github.com/viral-w3nuts/netlifycms.git 
git push -u origin master
